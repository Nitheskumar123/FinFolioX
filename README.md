🚀 FinFolio-X

An Agentic AI Framework for Intelligent Financial Decision-Making

FinFolio-X is an advanced multi-agent, multi-modal AI system designed to support intelligent trading decisions by combining technical analysis, financial news sentiment, market regime detection, uncertainty estimation, and risk-aware position sizing.

The system is built as a collection of specialized AI agents—including an LSTM-based technical forecasting agent, a Transformer (FinBERT) sentiment agent, a market regime detector, and a Bayesian uncertainty engine—whose outputs are fused using a hierarchical multi-head attention mechanism. This allows the model to dynamically prioritize signals based on market context, volatility, and confidence.

Unlike traditional single-model trading systems, FinFolio-X emphasizes agentic reasoning, explainability, robustness to noisy information, and capital preservation, reflecting how real quantitative trading systems operate.

⚠️ Status: Actively under development. Additional agent coordination (LangGraph), explainability (SHAP), adversarial robustness, and full backtesting are planned.
